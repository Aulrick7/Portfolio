https://github.com/Aulrick7/Portfolio

## About the project

I intially used one of the available templates from netlify created by https://github.com/TomasBankauskas, to which I designed and developed the rest on my own using react.

## Most notable feats

- Guided a 9-person cross-functional team to design and deliver an AI-powered debugging assistant integrating LLMs, React, and TensorFlow.

- Boosted model accuracy from 30% to 70% by engineering advanced few-shot learning pipelines and refining data processing strategies.

- Planned the system architecture and development roadmap, accelerating feature delivery while maintaining high code quality.

- Acted as primary technical liaison for clients, translating business requirements into scalable engineering solutions.

- Introduced Agile workflow improvements that increased sprint predictability and team velocity.
