## Github

https://github.com/Aulrick7/Portfolio

## About the project

I intially used one of the available templates from netlify created by https://github.com/TomasBankauskas, to which I designed and implemented site structure, UI components, and responsive layouts. Hosted the code and deployment setup on GitHub.

## Most notable feats

- Built and maintained a professional online portfolio website to showcase projects, skills, and personal profile.

- Implemented using modern front-end frameworks and tooling (Next.js, React, TypeScript, CSS).

- Organized repository with clean project structure and managed workflows using Git.

- Deployed and version-controlled via GitHub, demonstrating real-world application of web development practices.
