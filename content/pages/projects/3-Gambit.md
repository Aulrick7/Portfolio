  Gambit is a project where the user connects to an EEG device and use brain
  waves to control an object in a game. Each level consist of a maze with
  obstacles and the player gets to traverse through them to find an exit

## Github

Sorry signed a NDA for this

## About the game

This project was build in a 7 person team, and I was a senior developer for this game. This game was completely build in Unity with the OpenMaze Framework and LSL4. This is a 3d game that is solely build to utilise the brainwaves from eeg device to move an object through a maze filled with obstacles and puzzles. My main job here was to guide junior developers and solve merge conflicts while also optimizing and automating them by integrating smart merge, debug mode, and developer level.

## Notable Feats.

- Integrated EEG brainwave inputs using the OpenMaze framework to create adaptive, player-responsive gameplay systems, increasing player engagement by \~20% through real-time adaptive gameplay systems.

- Led advanced gameplay and system implementations, mentoring junior developers and enforcing engineering best practices.

- Boosted code efficiency by 30%, reducing performance overhead and increasing gameplay stability.

- Coordinated cross-team development efforts, strengthening communication and delivery timelines.
