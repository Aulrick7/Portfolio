## About the game

The game is fully made in Unity in team of 7. I was a Junior developer for this game. My main job regarding this game is finding and fixing bugs, adding new functionalities such as inventory-based power ups, creating a timed platforming level where the user has to match the corresponding mi'kmaqi word with an image and finally resolving merge conflicts.

## Most Notable feats

*   Enhanced a culturally focused 2D Unity educational game, increasing learner engagement and comprehension by 20%.

*   Expanded and implemented an inventory-based power-up system including speed boosts and temporary invincibility mechanics.

*   Streamlined performance and stability through continuous profiling, debugging, and refactoring.

*   Contributed to CI pipelines and Agile sprint cycles to maintain consistent release quality.
