## About the game

The game is fully made in Unity in team of 7. I was a Junior developer for this game. My main job regarding this game is finding and fixing bugs, adding new functionalities such as inventory-based power ups, creating a timed platforming level where the user has to match the corresponding mi'kmaqi word with an image.
