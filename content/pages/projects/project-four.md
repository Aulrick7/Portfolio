Sorry, signed a NDA for this

## About the project

Project DEEBug consisted of 9 members and I acted out as a technical director for this project. My main job was to find user stories that aligned with the client's expectations and goals and split the user stories into acceptance tasks and assign them to each member in team. I was also the main guy that ensure the gitflow was stable and maintained a stable build across the main branch. Furthermore, I assigned bi-weekly meetings with the client where we review the sprint and the progress of the project.

## Most notable feats

*   Guided a 9-person cross-functional team to design and deliver an AI-powered debugging assistant integrating LLMs, React, and TensorFlow.

*   Boosted model accuracy from 30% to 70% by engineering advanced few-shot learning pipelines and refining data processing strategies.

*   Planned the system architecture and development roadmap, accelerating feature delivery while maintaining high code quality.

*   Acted as primary technical liaison for clients, translating business requirements into scalable engineering solutions.

*   Introduced Agile workflow improvements that increased sprint predictability and team velocity.
