Sorry, Signed a NDA for this

## About the project

PoweredEV: https://poweredev.ca/
TempAlert: https://tempalert.org/

I developed the entire website from grounds up using html, css, javascript in wordpress. I also dabbled a bit on figma to create prototypes to see which variants the client prefers.

## Most notable feats

- Designed and delivered high-performance, responsive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WordPress, improving client brand visibility and user engagement.

- Diagnosed and resolved complex front-end and performance bottlenecks, achieving faster page load times and boosted cross-device compatibility.

- Applied UI/UX enhancements that strengthened conversion flows and overall user experience.

- Partnered directly with client to translate business goals into scalable web solutions and long-term technical strategies.
